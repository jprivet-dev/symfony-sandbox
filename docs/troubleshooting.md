# Troubleshooting

⬅️ [Go back to README](..%2FREADME.md)

## Error "address already in use" or "port is already allocated"

See [Symfony starter project](https://github.com/jprivet-dev/symfony-starter?tab=readme-ov-file#error-address-already-in-use-or-port-is-already-allocated).

## Editing permissions on Linux

If you work on linux and cannot edit some of the project files right after the first installation, you can run in that project `make permissions`, to set yourself as owner of the project files that were created by the docker container.
