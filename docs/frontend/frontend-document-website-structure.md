# Frontend - Document and website structure

## Semantic mark up

To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides dedicated tags that you can use to represent such sections, for example:

* header: `<header>`.
* navigation bar: `<nav>`.
* main content: `<main>`, with various content subsections represented by `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<div>` elements.
* sidebar: `<aside>`; often placed inside `<main>`.
* footer: `<footer>`.
